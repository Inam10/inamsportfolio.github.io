    <h2>Learn HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used
      language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in
      late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which
      was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was
      published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but
      currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01,
      and this version was published in 2012.

      Whether you’re interested in becoming a professional web developer or you
      simply want to learn more about how websites work, the first thing you
      need to study is HTML. HTML is the standard language that is used for
      creating webpages and web applications. Every time you access a website, a
      server sends an HTML file to your computer and your browser interprets and
      displays the information included in that file. In fact, all the
      information you are reading now is simply data that has been stored in an
      HTML file and sent to your browser. Here’s the best thing about HTML –
      it’s a simple language to learn. Most people can learn the basics of HTML
      in just a few hours, and with a solid HTML foundation, you can progress to
      more complex languages such as CSS and JavaScript.

    <h3>What is HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which can be a confusing term
      for many beginners. The best way to explain HTML is to examine the meaning
      of each word. HyperText refers to text that contains links to other texts.
      Every time you click on a highlighted or underlined link that takes you to
      another page, you are using hypertext. As more and more pages use
      hypertext to link to each other, a “web” of pages starts to form. This is
      where we get the term World Wide Web. Markup refers to the special symbols
      or codes that are inserted into a document to tell the web browser how to
      display the document data. For example, markup code may tell the browser
      to display a phrase in bold or italic text, or may tell the browser which
      parts of the document are headings and which are paragraphs. HTML is just
      one of a number of languages that uses markup code. Language refers to the
      idea that the code is standardized. Just like regular spoken languages,
      there are certain rules that everyone must follow when writing HTML. This
      is so that all browsers can understand and interpret the code. There are
      many different programming languages, and you may have heard of some of
      the popular ones such as Java, Python and Ruby. Each language has its own
      unique set of rules, and many languages can be used in combination with
      HTML to create amazing webpages and applications. If we put these three
      definitions together, we could say that HTML is “a programming language
      that uses unique code which allows you to display linked documents in a
      browser”.

      If you’ve done any research on web development and design, you’ve probably
      come across articles or guides that mention CSS and JavaScript. HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript are the three main languages that are used to create most
      webpages. Each of the languages has a different function and each has
      different rules, but they all work together to give webpages content,
      design and functionality. As we mentioned before, HTML is the foundation
      of any site. The HTML code contains the site’s basic structure and
      content, which includes all the text, links, tables, links to images and
      other such elements. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to define the
      design of the page, including things like the size of each element and how
      it looks. With CSS, you can set things like the style of the font you are
      using, the background color of the page, and the width of the border
      around elements on the page. JavaScript is a more complex language that is
      used to create interactive elements on your page. When you hover your
      mouse over an image on a website and the image morphs or changes, that’s
      JavaScript editing your original HTML code. When you click on a product on
      a shopping website and your shopping cart automatically updates, that’s
      JavaScript too. CSS and JavaScript can add design and functionality to a
      site, but without HTML, you won’t have a site to begin with. In fact, most
      sites will still display HTML data even if the CSS and JavaScript code is
      broken.
