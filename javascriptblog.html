    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is used by almost every website on the internet, so I embarked
      on a quest to find the best active JavaScript blogs for programmers. Each
      of these sites demonstrates technical expertise, is relatively easy to
      comprehend, publishes content consistently, and has stood the test of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. JavaScript is
      the programming language of the Web. JavaScript is easy to learn.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Study JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
    </br>
       1.HTML to define the content of web pages
</br>
        2. CSS to specify the layout of
      web pages 
</br>
      3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript rules the web because of its popularity. The programming language is used to create the client-side of the website. To write any interaction on mobile applications, web apps, or sites, you need to use JavaScript. While it is not the only programming language that professionals can use, it is better than most for front end development.</p>
