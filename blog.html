            <h2>Learn HTML</h2>
            <p>
              HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most
              widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created
              by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard
              HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a
              major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though
              HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having
              HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this
              version was published in 2012.

            <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
            <p>
              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines
              the structure and content of a web page, a Cascading Style Sheet
              is a web document that allows you to change the appearance of the
              HTML. CSS allows you to change the size, style, font, and color of
              text; margins and padding; background colors and border styles. It
              can also be used to position elements on a page (but weâ€™ll leave
              that for another day).

            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript is used by almost every website on the internet, so I
              embarked on a quest to find the best active JavaScript blogs for
              programmers. Each of these sites demonstrates technical expertise,
              is relatively easy to comprehend, publishes content consistently,
              and has stood the test of time.
