    <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Where HTML is what defines the
      structure and content of a web page, a Cascading Style Sheet is a web
      document that allows you to change the appearance of the HTML. CSS allows
      you to change the size, style, font, and color of text; margins and
      padding; background colors and border styles. It can also be used to
      position elements on a page (but we’ll leave that for another day).
    </p>
    <p>
      The best thing about CSS is that is allows you to make global style
      changes that affect every instance of a certain element throughout your
      blog or website so that you don’t have to make these changes at the
      individual page level. This saves you a ton of time when it comes to
      redesigning your blog. Here’s an example of what I mean: as we learned
      last week, the page title on a blog page is defined by an HTML element
      called an H1 (heading 1). By default, the browser displays an H1 as extra
      large, bold, black text, much like we saw in the PAWS example. If we want
      to change the color, font and size of all the H1’s on our blog to keep
      consistency throughout, all you need to do is define what all H1’s will
      look like in your CSS. Sometimes different browsers may display slightly
      different default styles. Using a style sheet to define what a specific
      element should look like can keep the look of your blog consistent from
      one browser to another as well as one device to another.
    </p>
    <h3>HOW DOES CSS WORK?</h3>
    <p>
      A very important piece of CSS is the “Cascading” part. The browser reads
      style definitions from top to bottom in a style sheet. This means that a
      style you define lower in the style sheet will override any previous
      styles defined earlier in the style sheet.
    </p>
    <h3>HOW CSS IS APPLIED</h3>
    <p>CSS is applied to HTML elements in a web page by declaring specific styles for each element. A style declaration looks like this:

        selector {
             property: value;
        }
        Let’s look at each of these pieces separately:
        
        Selector
        The selector is the piece of content that we want to target and style. It is either an HTML element or a Class Name.
        
        When defining an HTML element, we use the tag name without the opening and closing bracket. For example, the <p> (or paragraph tag) would simply be:
        
        p
        A Class Name always begins with a dot. For example,
        
        .big-font
        We’ll get more into classes in a bit.
        
        Property
        Properties and their respective values always live within curly braces:
        
        p {
        }
        Properties are predefined terms within CSS that all web browsers understand. They are things like:
        
        font-family, font-size, color, etc.
        
        p {
             font-family: 
             font-size: 
             color: 
        }
        A property is always followed by a colon (:)
        
        Value
        The value is the particular style or variable you choose to assign to a property. For example:
        
        p {
             font-family: Arial;
             font-size: 16px;
             color: gray;
        }
        A value is always followed by a semi-colon (;)
        
        So the example above tells the browser that we want all of our page titles (or any element surrounded by an <p> tag) to be displayed in Arial font at 16 pixels in size and in the color gray.
        
        Pretty easy, right? Let’s do another one.
        
        a {
             color: pink;
             font-weight: bold;
             text-decoration: none;
        }
        This example tells the browser to make all links (anchor tags that look like this: <a>) within our blog the color pink, bold, and not underlined. (Browsers by default display links in blue with an underline).
